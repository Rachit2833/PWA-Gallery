Hii, Out of three observation made from the site audit i preddered working
on the PWA (Progessive Web App Feature ) for i beliuve it is one of those 
feature which opens the great new possibility in the domain of web. It 
introduces web with some of the important native app feature, also its 
backed by google and is under continious developement. Most of the popular 
apps like whatsapp web , youtube blog sites work on this as it retains the 
user more than normal web apps.

After Correctly linking the JantaSW.js on side of the search bar you will get 
a install sign which will install the site as a PWA on your mobile or desktop

More feature can be built on top of this concept once recieving the 
complete source code
